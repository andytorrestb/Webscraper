# Webscraper
A simple web scraping script I am working on  using ruby. 

PLAN 

[x] STEP 1: Write a script to access and store relevant data on a webpage into a 2D array of the following form 

			items_array = [ ["title", "price"],
							["title", "price"],
							["title", "price"],
						  ]
[] STEP 2: Edit script to repeat the process above for multiple webpages 

[] STEP 3: Export array to a CSV file.
